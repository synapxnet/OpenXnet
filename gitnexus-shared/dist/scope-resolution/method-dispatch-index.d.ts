/**
 * `MethodDispatchIndex` — materialized view of class hierarchies keyed by
 * `DefId` (RFC §3.1; Ring 2 SHARED #914).
 *
 * Two O(1)-access maps used by `Registry.lookupMethod` and interface-
 * dispatch callers:
 *
 *   - `mroByOwnerDefId`       : owner class → full MRO ancestor chain
 *                               (excludes the owner itself, in per-language
 *                               strategy order).
 *   - `implsByInterfaceDefId` : interface/trait → classes that implement it.
 *
 * **Not an MRO implementation.** The build function is a pure aggregator: it
 * asks the caller (via `computeMro` and `implementsOf` callbacks) for the
 * per-language answers and materializes the two-way index. MRO strategies
 * live where they already do today (`model/resolve.ts § c3Linearize`,
 * `languages/ruby.ts § selectDispatch`, etc.) — this index does not
 * reimplement them.
 *
 * Why callbacks and not a shared strategy registry: the five strategies
 * (Python C3, Ruby kind-aware, Java/Kotlin linear, Rust qualified-syntax,
 * COBOL none) already exist in the CLI package and depend on the CLI's
 * `HeritageMap` + `SemanticModel`. Pulling them into `gitnexus-shared` would
 * require migrating both — out of scope for #914. Callbacks let the shared
 * build stay pure while honoring existing strategies verbatim.
 *
 * Consumed by: #917 (`Registry.lookupMethod` MRO fast path, interface
 * dispatch resolver).
