/**
 * `composeEvidence` — translate accumulated raw signals per candidate
 * into a `ResolutionEvidence[]` using the authoritative `EvidenceWeights`
 * map (RFC §4.3 + Appendix A; Ring 2 SHARED #917).
 *
 * Each `RawSignals` record describes what was observed about a candidate
 * during the 7-step walk: where it was found, at what depth, whether
 * anything corroborates it. This module turns those raw facts into the
 * typed evidence list attached to the outgoing `Resolution`.
 *
 * **Every weight comes from `EvidenceWeights`.** No inline magic numbers.
 * Extends issue #429 (centralize hardcoded confidence values).
 *
 * **Confidence compose rule.** Signals add; the sum is capped at 1.0 at
 * the call site (inside `lookupCore`). This module only emits the list;
 * it does NOT compute the capped sum so callers can inspect per-signal
 * contributions for debugging.
