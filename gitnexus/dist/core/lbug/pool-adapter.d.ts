 * LadybugDB Adapter (Connection Pool)
 *
 * Manages a pool of LadybugDB databases keyed by repoId, each with
 * multiple Connection objects for safe concurrent query execution.
 *
 * LadybugDB Connections are NOT thread-safe — a single Connection
 * segfaults if concurrent .query() calls hit it simultaneously.
 * This adapter provides a checkout/return connection pool so each
 * concurrent query gets its own Connection from the same Database.
 *
 * @see https://docs.ladybugdb.com/concurrency — multiple Connections
 * from the same Database is the officially supported concurrency pattern.
