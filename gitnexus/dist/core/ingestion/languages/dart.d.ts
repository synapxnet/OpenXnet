/**
 * Dart Language Provider
 *
 * Dart traits:
 *   - importSemantics: 'wildcard-leaf' (Dart imports bring everything public into scope)
 *   - exportChecker: public if no leading underscore
 *   - Dart SDK imports (dart:*) and external packages are skipped
 *   - enclosingFunctionFinder: Dart's tree-sitter grammar places function_body
 *     as a sibling of function_signature/method_signature (not as a child).
 *     The hook resolves the enclosing function by inspecting the previous sibling.
