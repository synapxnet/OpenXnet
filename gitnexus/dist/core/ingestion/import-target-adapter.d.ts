/**
 * Bridge between CLI-package per-language `ImportResolverFn`s and the
 * shared `FinalizeHooks.resolveImportTarget` contract
 * (RFC §5.2; Ring 2 PKG #922).
 *
 * The shared finalize algorithm (#915) asks one question:
 *
 *     resolveImportTarget(targetRaw, fromFile, workspaceIndex): string | null
 *
 * The CLI already has 16 language-specific resolvers satisfying a
 * richer signature:
 *
 *     ImportResolverFn(rawImportPath, filePath, resolveCtx): ImportResult
 *
 * This module builds a dispatch adapter — one FinalizeHook implementation
 * that looks up the file's language from its path and delegates to the
 * right per-language resolver. Callers package per-language resolvers +
 * a shared `ResolveCtx` into an opaque `ImportTargetWorkspace` and pass
 * it as `workspaceIndex` to `finalizeScopeModel`.
 *
 * ## What's deliberately NOT here
 *
 *   - **Re-implementation of any per-language resolver.** We wrap the
 *     existing `importResolver` field on each `LanguageProvider` — the
 *     same code path the legacy DAG uses today.
 *   - **Dynamic-import handling.** The shared finalize algorithm short-
 *     circuits `ParsedImport { kind: 'dynamic-unresolved' }` before
 *     calling `resolveImportTarget`, so the adapter never sees those.
 *   - **`importPathPreprocessor`.** Preprocessing belongs inside the
 *     provider's `interpretImport` hook (which writes the final
 *     `ParsedImport.targetRaw`). By the time finalize passes a
 *     `targetRaw` to this adapter, it is the string the provider wants
 *     resolved verbatim.
