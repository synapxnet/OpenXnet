/**
 * Pipeline orchestrator — dependency-ordered ingestion pipeline.
 *
 * The pipeline is composed of named phases with explicit dependencies.
 * Each phase is defined in its own file under `pipeline-phases/`.
 * The runner in `pipeline-phases/runner.ts` executes phases in
 * topological order, passing typed outputs from upstream phases as
 * inputs to downstream phases.
 *
 * To add a new phase:
 * 1. Create a new file in `pipeline-phases/` following the pattern
 * 2. Export it from `pipeline-phases/index.ts`
 * 3. Add it to the `ALL_PHASES` array below
 *
 * See ARCHITECTURE.md for the full phase dependency diagram.
