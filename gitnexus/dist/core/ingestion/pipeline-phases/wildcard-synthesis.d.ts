/**
 * Strategy implementation for `importSemantics: 'wildcard-transitive'` (C, C++).
 *
 * Textual-include languages chain symbols through files: if `dict.c` includes
 * `server.h` and `server.h` includes `dict.h`, then `dict.c` sees symbols from
 * all three files. This helper walks the include graph (combining both the
 * ingestion-context `importMap` and the graph-level IMPORTS edges) until the
 * closure is stable.
 *
 * **Order matters.** The returned `Set` preserves iteration order (insertion
 * order). `synthesizeWildcardImportBindings` dedupes bindings by symbol name
 * on a first-seen-wins basis, so this closure's ordering determines which
 * declaration wins when multiple headers export the same name (e.g. overloaded
 * free functions like `write_audit()` vs `write_audit(const char*)` in
 * different headers). We therefore:
 *   1. Seed the closure with direct imports in declaration order (matches the
 *      order of `#include` directives in the source file).
 *   2. Use FIFO / true BFS (`queue.shift()`) for transitive expansion, so
 *      closer headers are seen before deeper ones.
 *
 * Cycle-safe: the `closure.has(file)` guard prevents infinite loops on circular
 * header includes, which are valid C/C++ when paired with `#pragma once` or
 * include guards.
 *
 * Size-bounded: the closure is capped at `MAX_TRANSITIVE_CLOSURE_SIZE` files to
 * prevent OOM on pathological codebases (e.g. boost, monoheader kernel code)
 * where one translation unit can transitively reach tens of thousands of
 * headers. Partial closures still yield useful bindings for the cluster of
 * headers closest to the importer, which is what overload resolution and
 * cross-file call resolution care about.
 *
 * Queue implementation: uses a head-index over a growing array (O(1) dequeue)
 * instead of `Array.prototype.shift()` (O(n)) so deep chains stay linear.
