/**
 * Shadow-mode parity harness — dual-run observability for the RFC #909
 * registry rollout (RFC §6.3; Ring 2 PKG #923).
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 *   - Exposes `record({ language, callsite, legacy, newResult })` for
 *     every call site where the caller has BOTH a legacy-DAG resolution
 *     and a new `Registry.lookup` resolution.
 *   - Computes a `ShadowDiff` per record via shared `diffResolutions`
 *     (#918) and accumulates them in a per-language bucket.
 *   - At the end of a run, aggregates into a `ShadowParityReport` via
 *     shared `aggregateDiffs` (#918) — per-language parity %,
 *     evidence-kind breakdown of divergences, grand-total overall row.
 *   - Optionally persists the report as JSON under
 *     `.gitnexus/shadow-parity/` so the static dashboard at
 *     `gitnexus/shadow-parity-dashboard/` can render it offline.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do
 *
 *   - **Invoke either resolution path itself.** The caller must run
 *     legacy + `Registry.lookup` and pass results in. The harness is a
 *     side-car, not a dispatcher — this keeps call-processor integration
 *     surgical when it lands (tracked as a follow-up; the shared model
 *     doesn't dual-invoke on its own).
 *   - **Flip anything.** `REGISTRY_PRIMARY_<LANG>` lives in
 *     `registry-primary-flag.ts` (#924); the harness records the
 *     caller-supplied "which side is primary" bit for each record so the
 *     dashboard can label rows, but it does not consult the flag itself.
 *
 * ## Activation
 *
 * `GITNEXUS_SHADOW_MODE=1` (or `'true'`, `'yes'`, case-insensitive,
 * trimmed) enables the harness. When disabled, `record()` is a cheap
 * no-op: no accumulation, no allocation beyond the harness object
 * itself. Callers can always construct a harness and hand it through;
 * the "off" overhead is near-zero.
 *
 * ## Persistence shape
 *
 * When `persist()` is called, the harness writes TWO files:
 *
 *   - `<outputDir>/<runId>.json` — the timestamped snapshot (immutable)
 *   - `<outputDir>/latest.json`  — a pointer that the dashboard reads
 *
 * Both files contain the same `PersistedShadowReport` payload:
 *
 *   {
 *     schemaVersion: 1,
 *     runId: "<iso-8601>-<rand>",
 *     generatedAt: "<iso-8601>",
 *     primaryByLanguage: { [lang]: "legacy" | "registry" },
 *     report: <ShadowParityReport>
 *   }
 *
 * Schema-version-gated so future format changes don't silently confuse
 * older dashboards. The dashboard renders `report.perLanguage` rows and
 * annotates each with `primaryByLanguage[lang]`.
