/**
 * Registration Dispatch Table
 *
 * Behavior-grouped O(1) dispatch table for routing `SymbolTable.add()`
 * registrations into the semantic registries. Replaces the cascading
 * `if/else` ladder in `symbol-table.ts` with a `Map<NodeLabel, RoutingDecision>`
 * whose entries point to closure-captured hooks.
 *
 * ## Ownership diagram
 *
 *     SemanticModel
 *       ├── types   (TypeRegistry)    ← classLikeHook / implHook write here
 *       ├── methods (MethodRegistry)  ← methodHook writes here
 *       ├── fields  (FieldRegistry)   ← propertyHook writes here
 *       └── symbols (SymbolTable)     ← owns fileIndex + callableByName,
 *                                       calls dispatch() in add()
 *
 * ## Behavior groups (5 hooks, 13 table entries)
 *
 * | Group         | NodeLabel values                                  | Hook         | Skip callable? |
 * |---------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
 * | class-like    | Class, Struct, Interface, Enum, Record, Trait     | classLikeHook    | no             |
 * | method-like   | Method, Constructor                               | methodHook   | no             |
 * | property      | Property                                          | propertyHook | YES            |
 * | impl-block    | Impl                                              | implHook     | no             |
 * | callable-only | Function, Macro, Delegate                         | (no entry)   | no             |
 *
 * Every other `NodeLabel` is "inert" — reached by `fileIndex` only. No
 * specialized registry, no callable index append.
 *
 * ## How to add a new NodeLabel
 *
 * 1. Add the variant to the `NodeLabel` union in `gitnexus-shared/src/graph/types.ts`.
 * 2. Decide which behavior group it belongs to by asking "which lookups must
 *    return this symbol?" (not "what language feature is it?"). A new Swift
 *    `Extension` is class-like if you want owner-scoped method lookup on it;
 *    a new Kotlin `Object` is class-like for the same reason.
 * 3. Either:
 *    - Add a table entry here pointing at one of the existing hooks, OR
 *    - Add it to `CALLABLE_ONLY_LABELS` if it is a free callable, OR
 *    - Add it to `INERT_LABELS` if it's metadata-only (File, Folder, Decorator,
 *      etc.) — never queried via owner/class lookups.
 * 4. If none of the above fit — the new kind needs a brand-new registry —
 *    design the registry first in `model/`, then add a new hook closure
 *    and table entries. Update `DISPATCH_LABELS` / the exhaustiveness guard
 *    accordingly.
 *
 * The runtime exhaustiveness guard in `symbol-table.ts` will warn if a
 * `NodeLabel` is missing from all three sets.
