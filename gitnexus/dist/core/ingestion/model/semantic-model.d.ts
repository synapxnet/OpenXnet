/**
 * Semantic Model
 *
 * Top-level orchestrator for all resolution-time data. Owns:
 *
 *   - Three owner-scoped registries (types, methods, fields)
 *   - A nested SymbolTable (file + callable name indexes) wrapped so
 *     that `add()` fans out into the registries via the dispatch table
 *
 * ## Dependency direction
 *
 *     gitnexus-shared (NodeLabel)             — leaf
 *          ↑
 *     symbol-table.ts                         — pure file/callable index
 *          ↑
 *     model/type-registry / method-registry / field-registry
 *          ↑
 *     model/registration-table.ts             — dispatch table factory
 *          ↑
 *     model/semantic-model.ts                 — THIS FILE (orchestrator)
 *          ↑
 *     resolve.ts, call-processor.ts, resolution-context.ts, ...
 *
 * `symbol-table.ts` is a leaf — it never imports from `./model/`. This
 * file (semantic-model.ts) is the ONLY place where SymbolTable and the
 * owner-scoped registries are composed. Upstream consumers pass around
 * the `SemanticModel` interface and reach into `.symbols` for file-scoped
 * operations or `.types` / `.methods` / `.fields` for owner-scoped ones.
 *
 * ## Fan-out via wrapped add()
 *
 * `createSemanticModel()` creates a pure SymbolTable, creates the three
 * registries, builds a dispatch table via `createRegistrationTable`, and
 * exposes a SymbolTable-shaped façade whose `add()`:
 *
 *   1. Calls `rawSymbols.add()` — writes the fileIndex + callable index
 *      and returns the fully-built `SymbolDefinition`.
 *   2. Runs pre-dispatch normalization (`Function`-with-`ownerId` routes
 *      as `Method`).
 *   3. Looks up the dispatch table and invokes the hook, which writes to
 *      the appropriate owner-scoped registry.
 *
 * The wrapper is the only place where the two layers are combined. A
 * direct `createSymbolTable()` caller (e.g. an isolated unit test) gets
 * the pure, registry-free behavior — no surprises, no hidden side
 * effects.

/**
 * Aggregated read-only view of the semantic registries plus the nested
 * file/callable SymbolTable.
 *
 * `symbols` is typed as {@link SymbolTableReader} — consumers can query
 * symbols but cannot register new ones or trigger a reset. Callers that
 * need to register symbols or reset state must hold a
 * {@link MutableSemanticModel} reference instead, which widens
 * `symbols` back to {@link SymbolTableWriter} and adds `clear()` on the
 * model itself.
 *
 * This segregation is the runtime half of the principle of least
 * authority: a resolver that receives `SemanticModel` physically cannot
 * mutate the index, so it cannot desync the leaf from the owner-scoped
 * registries even accidentally.
