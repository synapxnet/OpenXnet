/**
 * Symbol Table — file-indexed + callable-name symbol storage.
 *
 * This module is a PURE LEAF in the ingestion dependency hierarchy. It owns
 * two orthogonal O(1) indexes:
 *
 *   1. fileIndex      — Map<filePath, Map<name, SymbolDefinition[]>>
 *                       for same-file lookups (Tier 1 resolution)
 *   2. callableByName — Map<name, SymbolDefinition[]>
 *                       for name-keyed callable lookups (Tier 3 widen)
 *
 * SymbolTable deliberately knows NOTHING about the owner-scoped registries
 * (types, methods, fields) that sit above it in the dependency graph. Those
 * registries live in `model/` and depend on SymbolTable, not the other way
 * around. {@link createSemanticModel} composes this pure SymbolTable with the
 * registries and wraps `add()` to fan out registrations into both layers.
 *
 * Dependency direction (strictly enforced):
 *
 *     gitnexus-shared (NodeLabel)       — leaf type
 *          ↑
 *     symbol-table.ts                   — THIS FILE (pure storage)
 *          ↑
 *     model/type-registry.ts, method-registry.ts, field-registry.ts
 *          ↑
 *     model/registration-table.ts       — dispatch table factory
 *          ↑
 *     model/semantic-model.ts           — orchestrator, wraps add()
 *          ↑
 *     model/resolve.ts, call-processor.ts, resolution-context.ts, ...
 *
 * No arrow ever points downward from this file. If you are tempted to
 * import from `./model/` here, you are going the wrong way — move the
 * logic up the dependency chain instead.

 * Exported as a `readonly` tuple so that `typeof CLASS_TYPES_TUPLE[number]`

 * imports this tuple and uses `Record<ClassLikeLabel, 'dispatch'>` in a
 * `satisfies` intersection to enforce at COMPILE TIME that every label
 * listed here is also classified as dispatch in `LABEL_BEHAVIOR`. Adding
 * a new class-like label to this tuple without updating `LABEL_BEHAVIOR`

 * `impl Trait for Struct`, and Scala traits all contribute methods to the
