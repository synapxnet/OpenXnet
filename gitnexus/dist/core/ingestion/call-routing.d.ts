/**
 * Shared Ruby call routing logic.
 *
 * Ruby expresses imports and property definitions as method calls rather
 * than syntax-level constructs. This module provides a routing function
 * used by the CLI call-processor, CLI parse-worker, and the web
 * call-processor so that the classification logic lives in one place.
 *
 * Heritage (mixins: include/extend/prepend) was previously routed here
 * but is now handled by heritageExtractor.extractFromCall before the
 * call router runs.  The router still returns 'skip' for these calls.
 *
 * NOTE: This file is intentionally duplicated in gitnexus-web/ because the
 * two packages have separate build targets (Node native vs WASM/browser).
 * Keep both copies in sync until a shared package is introduced.
