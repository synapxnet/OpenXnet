/**
 * `finalizeScopeModel` — turn a workspace's `ParsedFile[]` into a
 * materialized `ScopeResolutionIndexes` (RFC §3.2 Phase 2; Ring 2 PKG #921).
 *
 * Thin integration glue, per issue #884's boundary: all algorithmic logic
 * lives in `gitnexus-shared` (finalize algorithm #915, the four per-file
 * indexes #913, the method-dispatch materialization #914, the scope tree
 * #912). This file does three things only:
 *
 *   1. Map `ParsedFile[]` → `FinalizeInput` and call shared `finalize()`.
 *   2. Build the four workspace-wide indexes from the union of per-file
 *      defs/scopes/modules/qualified-names.
 *   3. Bundle the results into `ScopeResolutionIndexes` for
 *      `MutableSemanticModel.attachScopeIndexes(...)`.
 *
 * ## What this module is NOT responsible for
 *
 *   - Invoking tree-sitter or running AST walks. That's the extractor (#919).
 *   - Per-language import-target resolution. Hooks are plumbed through
 *     but default to "unresolved" when no provider supplies them — the
 *     real adapters land with #922.
 *   - Populating `ReferenceIndex`. That's the resolution phase (#925).
 *   - Deciding which language uses registry-primary lookup. That's the
 *     flag reader (#924).
 *
 * ## Empty-input behavior
 *
 * When `parsedFiles` is empty (the common case today — no language has
 * migrated yet), the orchestrator produces a valid but empty bundle: all
 * indexes are zero-sized, the scope tree is empty, and
 * `finalize.stats.totalFiles === 0`. This lets downstream consumers
 * safely consult `model.scopes` without branching on presence.
