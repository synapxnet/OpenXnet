/**
 * COBOL Processor
 *
 * Standalone regex-based processor for COBOL and JCL files.
 * Follows the markdown-processor.ts pattern: takes (graph, files, allPathSet),
 * does its own extraction, and writes directly to the graph.
 *
 * Pipeline:
 *   1. Separate programs from copybooks
 *   2. Build copybook map (name -> content)
 *   3. For each program: expand COPY statements, then run regex extraction
 *   4. Map CobolRegexResults to graph nodes and relationships
 *   5. Optionally process JCL files for job-step cross-references
