/**
 * MRO (Method Resolution Order) Processor
 *
 * Walks the inheritance graph (EXTENDS/IMPLEMENTS edges), collects methods from
 * each ancestor via HAS_METHOD edges, detects method-name collisions across
 * parents, and applies language-specific resolution rules to emit METHOD_OVERRIDES edges.
 *
 * Language-specific rules:
 * - C++:       leftmost base class in declaration order wins
 * - C#/Java:   class method wins over interface default; multiple interface
 *              methods with same name are ambiguous (null resolution)
 * - Python:    C3 linearization determines MRO; first in linearized order wins
 * - Rust:      no auto-resolution — requires qualified syntax, resolvedTo = null
 * - Default:   single inheritance — first definition wins
 *
 * METHOD_OVERRIDES edge direction: Class → Method (not Method → Method).
 * The source is the child class that inherits conflicting methods,
 * the target is the winning ancestor method node.
 * Cypher: MATCH (c:Class)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'METHOD_OVERRIDES'}]->(m:Method)
